pnr_subscription()
----------------------------
*The function serves as a facade to ease the interaction with Serviceplatformen's 'SF6002 - CPR Abonnement' service when wanting to add, or remove a pnr subscription.
The type of operation you want to perform depends on the type of operation that is assigned to the operation parameter key when calling the function.*
